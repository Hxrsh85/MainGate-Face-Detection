# Main Gate Face Recognition/Verification

Current idea
Verification: 1:1 matching. Basically detects that the person is who he claims to be.
Recognition: 1:k(k=number of people in the dataset) matching. Returns the identity of the person standing in front of the camera.

1. use object detection to detect faces.
2. use face recognition to recognize faces.
